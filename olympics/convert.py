# Strategy:
# (1) Create a dictionary that maps athlete IDs to athlete names
#       and then save the results in athletes.csv
# (2) Create a dictionary that maps event names to event IDs
#       and then save the results in events.csv

#       for our new event_results.csv table

# the athlete_events.csv files. This is not necessary--you can do it all
# in a single pass.
